# Redhill Airport ATIS App

A modern, reliable iOS app providing real-time ATIS (Automatic Terminal Information Service) and METAR data for [Redhill Aerodrome](https://redhillaerodrome.com) (EGKR) in Surrey, UK.

## Why This App Exists

Redhill Aerodrome's weather information system has several limitations that can be frustrating for pilots and aviation enthusiasts:
